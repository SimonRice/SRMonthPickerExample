# SRMonthPicker Example

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/simonrice/SRMonthPickerExample.png)](https://travis-ci.org/simonrice/SRMonthPickerExample)

A very simple example project for [SRMonthPicker](https://github.com/simonrice/SRMonthPicker), demonstrating many of the properties & methods available to use.  This particular example uses Storyboards, but SRMonthPicker can work equally well with legacy Interface Builder or via code.

## Compiling

SRMonthPicker itself isn't included in this project & therefore opening the XCode project here won't compile.

The easiest way by far of getting this project to compile is by using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).  Once you've got that up & running, all you need to do is type `pod install` on your terminal & open up the generated `SRMonthPickerExample.xcworkspace` file, as instructed.

If for any reason you don't wish to use CocoaPods, create an ARC-enabled project with a copy of all of [SRMonthPicker's](https://github.com/simonrice/SRMonthPicker) `SRMonthPicker.{m,h}` & all of the non-project files from this repository.

## Contributions

As everyone says, GitHub is about social coding - I didn't just choose to use it because of my love of git as a version control system.  Please do chip in & help make this even better.
